    "summary": "The current temperature is 28.6\u00b0C with a light breeze of 15.5 km/h and good air quality. Over the next few hours, the temperature is expected to rise slightly, reaching around 30.4\u00b0C, with no rain anticipated, although the wind may pick up a bit. The risk of river flooding is low, so outdoor activities should be safe. I recommend going for a walk since the weather is pleasant and conditions are favorable. However, a trip to the swimming pool might be refreshing as well since the temperature is comfortably warm. Enjoy your day outdoors!"
